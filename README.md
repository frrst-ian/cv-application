## Project Challenges

One of the main challenges in this project is figuring out how to integrate live preview using react state. I've restarted this project many times because my project structure is not always working. I've learned that it is important to do research before creating any project instead of attacking it directly with no specifications ready. This projects takes almost three months because of my priorities outside of web development, one of these is academics.

## Thoughts and Observations

Looking back, this project taught me a lot , from , using react components , revisiting  CSS  , and doing a lot of research. During the journey , I learned the  basics of react framework on my own capabilities and understand it by practicing.

## Future Enhancements

The project lacks input validation , which is important in user interaction. If I changed my mind , I will try to add input validation in the future.
